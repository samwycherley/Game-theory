# Game Theory

These are some notes I started during my masters and which have grown much longer ever since. They are still a work-in-progress.

Recent additions:
- Uniqueness of Nash equilibria
- Potential games and best response dynamics
- Supermodular games

If you find errors/typos etc., please let me know.
